# webspace-nazira
I decided that I want my webspace be like my fictional studio. And as it is the space on the Internet, where all the information became public, I want it to behave as I have guests and tour them. To create this feeling, I decided to add small character guiding visitors and representing myself. It is not very visible, so not everybody will find it. It works the same as in real life: sometimes you enter the studio and can find me working and sometimes do not. As it is some kind of a tour works are shown one after another with short comments. 
In teas of design decisions I decided to focus on a statement that my studio is full of light, so the background represents wall of the studio reflecting the light outside the window. In the daytime it is yellow and orange, at night it is shades of blue. I want my studio to be spacious, so there is a lot of empty space around.
